## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Base Stack**: Production-grade integration of TanStack Start, Nitro, Drizzle ORM, and Better Auth.
- **Authentication**: Email OTP sign-in/sign-up, passkey support, and optional Google OAuth. Rate limited at 20 requests per 60 seconds via Better Auth's built-in rate limiting.
- **Protected routes**: `/dashboard` and `/settings` require a valid session. Auth routes (`/login`, `/signup`) redirect signed-in users away automatically.
- **Notes CRUD**: List, create, and delete notes from the dashboard. Notes are scoped to the signed-in user via a `userId` foreign key. Dashboard table powered by `@tanstack/react-table`.
- **Account settings**: `/settings` route — profile, linked providers, registered passkeys, and delete account.
- **File uploads**: Presigned PUT upload flow via `POST /api/upload-url`. Works with MinIO (local), AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Supabase Storage — swap backends via `MINIO_ENDPOINT`.
- **Email**: Transactional email with Resend and React Email. OTP and verification templates included. Sender address configurable via `EMAIL_FROM`.
- **Design System**: Hyper-minimalist dark-first aesthetic with a shadcn-based component library.
- **Observability**: LogTape structured logging with a Sentry sink and SSR instrumentation.
- **Architecture**: Feature-based structure (`src/features`) with clear server-function data boundaries.
- **CI and Tooling**: GitHub Actions pipeline — lint, typecheck, format, unit tests, E2E tests, and build. Bun pinned to `1.3.13` with dependency caching across all jobs.
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E and Vitest unit test suites. Tests cover auth route guards, notes model, mailer guard, storage validation, and email send guard.
- **Documentation**: `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Security

- `sendDefaultPii: false` in Sentry — PII is not forwarded by default.
- `tracesSampleRate: 0.1` — conservative server trace sampling to control cost.
- `/sentry-example` and `/api/sentry-example` return 404 in production builds.
- `POST /api/send-email` requires an authenticated session or a valid `x-email-secret` header matching `EMAIL_API_SECRET`.
- Google OAuth and Resend are optional — the app boots and authenticates without either configured.
